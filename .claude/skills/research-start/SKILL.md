## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

This project's headquarters lives in the sibling repository `../soul-hq` —
research, designs, the roadmap, and the journey for the whole ecosystem live
there, not in this repo.

**Follow `../soul-hq/.claude/skills/research-start/SKILL.md`** with the component
preset to `soulstream-workloads`, performing every file operation, the quality gate
(`make fmt && make test && make lint`), and the signed commit inside
`../soul-hq` (never push — pushing stays a human act). If the sibling
checkout is missing, stop and say so instead of improvising.
