## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as: a kebab-case `<slug>` (required, first token), and
optionally the research question in the remaining text. If the slug is missing
or not kebab-case, ask for it instead of guessing.

## Steps

1. **Refuse duplicates and illegal states.** If `hq/01-RESEARCH/<slug>/`
   already exists, stop and report it. Read `hq/00-GENESIS/how-we-work.md`
   (Research section) if you have not this session.

2. **Create the topic folder** `hq/01-RESEARCH/<slug>/` containing:
   - `README.md` — a copy of `hq/01-RESEARCH/TEMPLATE.md` with the title,
     `**State:** active`, `**Started:** <today>`, and — if the user supplied
     the question — the Abstract and Question sections drafted from it. The
     **pre-registered bars must be written before any spike runs**: if the
     user's input doesn't determine them yet, draft them with the user now
     (they are the point of the file), never leave placeholder text and move
     on. Include the Reversal condition, phrased as observable evidence.
   - `JOURNEY.md` — a header line naming the topic and start date, otherwise
     empty; the investigation appends here as it happens.

3. **Register the topic** in the "Active topics" table in
   `hq/01-RESEARCH/README.md`.

4. **Commit (never push).** Stage **only** `hq/01-RESEARCH/<slug>/` and the
   updated `hq/01-RESEARCH/README.md` by explicit pathspec (never `git add
   .`/`-A`), then create a signed commit: `research(<slug>): open topic —
   <one-line question>`, ending with the repository's standard co-author
   trailer. Pushing is the human's act; remind them research is always pushed
   (`git push`) so the trail exists even if the topic is later abandoned.

5. **Report**: the folder path, the bars as registered, and the reminder that
   the topic ends only through `/research-graduate <slug> --to
   design|artifact|abandoned`.
